### Testing for MyKitchen App.
#### Anonymous User  
    i. Anonymous Users will not see the link to MyKitchen in the navbar. If the user tries to type in the url, he/she will be 
    directed to the login page. 

#### Authenticated Users
    1. Dashboard/ Infoboard.  
    i. When an authenticated user is logged in, he/she will be able to see MyKitchen link in the navbar menu.  
    ii. On entering the homepage, the user will see a message on the dashboard to register the household and link other  
    grocery shop customers/users who are household members.  
    iii. In the navbar, the user will see the menu item : Back to Shop, MyKitchen Home, Register Home Profile, and Logout links.    
    iv. The user will also see a shopping cart in the navbar.  

    2. Home Profile Functionality  
    i. Registering Home Profile  
    * With an empty household name input, if submit button is clicked, form will not submit and user will see an error message to
        request user to fill up the form.
    * With a valid household name and no household members, form will be validated and submitted. This is because it is possible
        to have a single member household (which is just the household owner).  
    * The drop down list to select household members will show a list of users who are not members of any current household.   
    * Users will not be able to add existing e-grocery shoppers who are members of other household to their own household.  
    * However, users will be able to add any "free" unlinked e-grocery shoppers as their household member.

    ii. Viewing Home Profile.  
    * Upon registration, user will be able to see a link View Home Profile in the navbar instead of Register Home Profile.  
    * On clicking this link, users will be taken to a page that shows the household name and the current listed members.

    * The household profile edit button in blue, is below the home profile details on the view home profile page.
    * On clicking the edit button, users will be directed to a page with a form to update the household profile information.  
    * Again the same logic applies as the home registration page. Users will not be able to add members of other household 
        to their household membership. However, they are free to add unlinked users to their household membership. This is
        possible as the form select list is filtered against members and owners of existing household.  
    * User(Household owners) will need to check the delete button if they wish to exclude certain users from their household 
        membership.  
    * On form validated and successful submission, User will be directed to the MyKitchen Dashboard/Infoboard. They will see  
        a update success message. Your household profile `<household name>` has been edited on `<date>`.

    iv. Deleting Home Profile  
    * On the view home profile page, household owner will be able to see a delete button in red, just below the household profile
    information, next to the edit button.
    * On clicking this button, a modal will popup asking user to confirm household profile deletion.
    * When confirm button is clicked, users will be redirected to the MyKitchen Dashboard with the household deletion success
    message.
    * User will be deregistered of all household and will again see the message to tell him/her to register and link household
    members again on the MyKitchen Dashboard.

    3. Storage CRUD Functionality
