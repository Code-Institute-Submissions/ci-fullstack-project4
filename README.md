# Cloudberry Grocer E-Commerce Website

## Project Objectives
This website is created to serve users who are customers of online grocery purchases. With the advancement in technology, users these 
days are spoilt for choice when purchasing groceries online. There are many e-commerce services that provide the users with a huge variety 
of choice when it comes to food products.Other than grocery purchase, this site also offers a small service to the registered shoppers. 
A side app allows user to manage their purchased product inventory and offers to track their product expiry date for them on the 
app's dashboard.

## UX/UI
### Overview and Colour
The colour on this website is chosen to be bright and cheery to give customers a bright and cheerful experience when they shop. The 
bright background also serves to highlight the products available. The site name is chosen because just like the berry which is a rarity
in other parts of the world, I hope the site is also rare and the experience of using it gives the users a good and special feeling 
that they are well served.
